## 💡 Course Overview & Philosophy

CS50x is more than just a programming course; it's a foundation in **computational thinking**. This companion repository aims to solidify your understanding by:

* **Deconstructing Complex Concepts:** Providing clear explanations of algorithms and data structures.
* **Structured Study:** Offering notes and summaries mapped directly to the weekly lectures.
* **Focus on Problem Solving:** Guiding you towards solutions without giving away the answers.

> **Our Core Principle:** Learning is an active process. We prioritize conceptual understanding over rote memorization or easy solutions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Official Enrollment

Ensure you are enrolled in the official [CS50x 2025 Track on edX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-2).

### 2. P-Set Policy (Crucial!)

**We strictly adhere to CS50's academic honesty policy.**

> 🛑 **NO DIRECT SOLUTIONS:** This repository **WILL NOT** contain direct, copy-pasteable solutions to any Problem Set.
>
> * **What we provide:** Conceptual breakdowns, necessary library function reminders, and strategic **pseudocode** to guide your implementation.

### 3. Repository Structure

All detailed notes and summaries are located in the dedicated `Weeks/` directory:


* **Organized Structure:** Notes mapped directly to the official CS50x 2025 lecture weeks.
* **Key Concept Summaries:** Quick reference guides for crucial algorithms, data structures, and syntax.
* **Strategic Hints:** Guidance on approaching Problem Sets (P-Sets) without compromising the self-discovery process.

## 📚 Prerequisites to Get Started

1.  **Enrollment:** Make sure you are registered for the official [CS50x course on edX](https://www.www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science).
2.  **Environment:** Set up your development environment, preferably using the official [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/) or your local VS Code setup.

### 🎯 How to Use This Repository

For each week, navigate to the `Weeks` folder and look for the corresponding file (e.g., `Week_1_C_Basics.md`).

#### Example: Week 1 - C Language

**Key Concepts Covered:**

* Libraries, Compilation, and Functions.
* Variables, Data Types (`int`, `float`, `char`), and I/O.
* Loops (`for`, `while`) and Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`).
* The basics of pointers and memory addresses.

**Notes on Problem Sets (P-Sets):**

> **🚨 Important Notice:** This repository **does not provide direct solutions** to the Problem Sets. The core learning experience of CS50 comes from struggling with and solving the problems yourself.
>
> * **Hints Section:** Inside the notes file for each week, you will find a dedicated section offering **hints and high-level thinking strategies** to guide you toward the correct solution without giving it away.
