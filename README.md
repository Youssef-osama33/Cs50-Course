## 📚 Prerequisites to Get Started

1.  **Enrollment:** Make sure you are registered for the official [CS50x course on edX](https://www.www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science).
2.  **Environment:** Set up your development environment, preferably using the official [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/) or your local VS Code setup.

### 🎯 How to Use This Repository

For each week, navigate to the `Weeks` folder and look for the corresponding file (e.g., `Week_1_C_Basics.md`).

#### Example: Week 1 - C Language

**Key Concepts Covered:**

* Libraries, Compilation, and Functions.
* Variables, Data Types (`int`, `float`, `char`), and I/O.
* Loops (`for`, `while`) and Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`).
* The basics of pointers and memory addresses.

**Notes on Problem Sets (P-Sets):**

> **🚨 Important Notice:** This repository **does not provide direct solutions** to the Problem Sets. The core learning experience of CS50 comes from struggling with and solving the problems yourself.
>
> * **Hints Section:** Inside the notes file for each week, you will find a dedicated section offering **hints and high-level thinking strategies** to guide you toward the correct solution without giving it away.
