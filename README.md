## 💡 What is CS50x 2025?

CS50x is a comprehensive introduction to the intellectual enterprise of computer science and the art of programming. It is designed for both majors and non-majors with little to no prior programming experience. The 2025 version continues to emphasize computational thinking, problem-solving, and practical application across various technologies.

**Why Use This Companion?**

* **Organized Structure:** Notes mapped directly to the official CS50x 2025 lecture weeks.
* **Key Concept Summaries:** Quick reference guides for crucial algorithms, data structures, and syntax.
* **Strategic Hints:** Guidance on approaching Problem Sets (P-Sets) without compromising the self-discovery process.

## 📚 Getting Started with CS50x 2025

1.  **Enroll:** Register for the official [CS50x course on edX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-2) (ensure you are on the 2025 track).
2.  **Development Environment:** Set up your environment using the recommended **CS50 VS Code Environment** or the local VS Code installation.

### 🎯 P-Set Guidance Policy

> **⚠️ ATTENTION:** To preserve the integrity of the course and maximize your learning, **direct Problem Set solutions are strictly prohibited.**
>
> * We provide **strategic hints, pseudocode structure, and conceptual reminders** within the weekly notes files to guide your thinking. Please treat this repository as a supplementary study aid, not a solution manual.

## 📚 Prerequisites to Get Started

1.  **Enrollment:** Make sure you are registered for the official [CS50x course on edX](https://www.www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science).
2.  **Environment:** Set up your development environment, preferably using the official [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/) or your local VS Code setup.

### 🎯 How to Use This Repository

For each week, navigate to the `Weeks` folder and look for the corresponding file (e.g., `Week_1_C_Basics.md`).

#### Example: Week 1 - C Language

**Key Concepts Covered:**

* Libraries, Compilation, and Functions.
* Variables, Data Types (`int`, `float`, `char`), and I/O.
* Loops (`for`, `while`) and Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`).
* The basics of pointers and memory addresses.

**Notes on Problem Sets (P-Sets):**

> **🚨 Important Notice:** This repository **does not provide direct solutions** to the Problem Sets. The core learning experience of CS50 comes from struggling with and solving the problems yourself.
>
> * **Hints Section:** Inside the notes file for each week, you will find a dedicated section offering **hints and high-level thinking strategies** to guide you toward the correct solution without giving it away.
